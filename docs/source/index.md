# Welcome to the coffea documentation

Welcome! Coffea is a python toolkit that blends columnar data analysis with a flexible execution layer so you can develop locally and scale out seamlessly.
These pages walk through the concepts, user guides, examples, and API reference you need to build and deploy analyses.

- **Start here** if you are new to coffea: the {doc}`getting_started/index` section covers installation, key ideas, and a complete processor walkthrough.
- **User guide** dives deeper into everyday workflows such as executor configuration.
- **Examples** showcase real notebooks you can run locally or on Binder to explore common analysis patterns.
- **API reference** documents every public class and function for quick lookup.
